Approvals

If you are an approver, you can use the approvals page to view all pending time/holidays submitted
to you which you can then approve or reject each one.

Booking

Please enter your project code, task number and the amount of hours you want to submit for each day.
 Then, select each day you want to submit time for, which will remain highlighted once selected.
 You can then add any extra comments and finally, submit the time. You will be able to see how many
 hours you have booked for the month, how may you have left for the month to book and your expected
 hours for the month.

 Calendar Page

 Here you can view all your submitted time for the month; all days which have been highlighted
 show that you have submitted time on that day. You can also view how much time you have booked,
 how much time you have left to book and the total amount of expected time you need to book for
 the month.

Holidays

When you submit holidays using the time booking page, they will appear in the holidays section. Here
you can then enter the holiday authorisation project code and then chose your holiday approver. You
can then submit them for approval off the appropriate person.
